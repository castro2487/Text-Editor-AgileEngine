# Text-Editor-AgileEngine
This application is part of the Advanced Text Editor Challenge from Agile Engine

# Summary

<ul>
  <li>Users can interact with <strong>words</strong> of text by double clicking them. This opens a Modal window with a Control Panel to adjust color and text format.</li>
  <li>Available formatting options are <strong>Bold</strong>, <i>Italic</i>, <u>Underline</u> and Color.</li>
  <li>As part of the same Modal and after a short delay, users will be able to see a list of synonyms for the selected word, and clicking any of them will replace the selected word while keeping all formatting settings.</li>
  <li>The solution is built primarily with React and Redux, specifically the re-ducks pattern, so it can be easily extended.</li>
  <li>For styles and markup, the application sticks with the same approach as the React Challenge Skeleton (for simplicity).</li>
  <li>Application state is preserved in local storage, so all the text and formatting options are persisted in a in-memory model.</li>
  <li>A TextForm is available for changing the Editor text.</li>
</ul>
